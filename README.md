# Sorting Algorithm 

* Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. 
* Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order.

### In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting
* Algorithms do not require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place or for example, within the array itself. This is called in-place sorting. Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting.
* Some sorting algorithms, the program requires space which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted. Sorting which uses equal or more space is called not-in-place sorting. Merge-sort is an example of not-in-place sorting.
